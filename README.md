Hi All,

I'm Jamie, and I like coffee, physics, books, and jinenkan karate. I'm sick of stereotypes that women aren't working in physics and math and computer science and engineering. It's just not true anymore. It is true that there are some Fritz Zwicky dicks (FZD) left in STEM fields whose egos are so big and voices are so loud that no one else can get a word or proposal in edgewise. Sure, FZDs may be brilliant, but they are extremely difficult to work with and end up doing bad science. If you're one of those FZD, or near the FZD cutoff, reconsider your social skills and be a better and more inclusive collaborator.
